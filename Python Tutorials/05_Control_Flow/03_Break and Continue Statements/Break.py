# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Iterate over the list
for number in numbers:
    # Check if the number is greater than 5
    if number > 5:
        # If it is, print the number and exit the loop
        print("Found a number greater than 5:", number)
        break


#output
# Found a number greater than 5: 6
